INTRODUCTION                                    *bg*

Tired of waiting for `grep` on very large directory trees? Or for `make` to
complete while you want to edit somewhere else? Look no further.

COMMANDS                                        *bg-commands*

:Bg {args}              Run an arbitrary command and pipe its output into the
                        quickfix window. If the output matches 'errorformat',
                        it will be highlighted and navigable via |:cnext|, etc.

:Bgadd {args}           Like |:Bg|, but append the output to the quickfix-list.
