INTRODUCTION                                    *bg*

Tired of waiting for `grep` on very large directory trees? Or for `make` to
complete while you want to edit somewhere else? Look no further.

COMMANDS                                        *bg-commands*

                                                *:Bggrep*
:Bg {args}              Run an arbitrary command and pipe its output into the
                        quickfix window. If the output matches 'errorformat',
                        it will be highlighted and navigable via |:cnext|, etc.

                                                *:Bgadd*
:Bgadd {args}           Like |:Bg|, but append the output to the quickfix-list.

                                                *:Bgstop*
:Bgstop                 Stop all background jobs.

                                                *:Bgjobs*
:Bgjobs                 List all background jobs

                                                *:Bgclear*

Convenience Commands ~

:Bggrep {args}          Like |:grep|, but run `grep` in the background.
                        Respects 'grepprg' and its "$*" placeholder.

                                                *:Bggrepadd*
:Bggrepadd {args}       Like |:Bggrep|, but append the output to the
                        quickfix-list.

                                                *:Bgmake*
:Bgmake {args}          Like `:make`, but run `make` in the background.
                        Respects 'makeprg' and its "$*" placeholder.

LOCATION LIST                                   *bg-location-list*

The location list can be used instead of the quickfix list, by using the |:Bgl|
commands instead of their |:Bg| counterparts.
